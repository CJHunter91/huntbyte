<p>To gain a better understanding of HTML and CSS I created this page without any templates. It was also a way of learning how to setup a website, server hosting and buying a domain name. I have now incorporated Bootstrap a free framework combined with my own CSS files. I felt this was a key framework to learn as it is used by many websites and has many built in features. I have recently implemented my own javascrpit code to give the website a little more user interactivity.</p>
<p>The web page now has a basic php contact form with form validation an anti-spam field which randomly generates different answers. &nbsp;A user login connected to a mysql database is now up and running. Once logged in I have access to a simple CMS to update the website, just like this paragraph.</p>
<p>The fieldwork cafe website is now live and was created using the Wordpress CMS. <a href="http://www.fieldworkcafe.co.uk" target="_blank">Click here to visit the site</a></p>
