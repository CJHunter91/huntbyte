<p>Hello and welcome to HuntByte.com.</p>
<p>This is a website of my own design and creation and has links to other projects I have worked on.</p>
<p>My name is Chris Hunter and I am an Edinburgh Napier University science graduate. After a while of searching for a career, I started to learn Computer Programming. Using any resources possible to learn in my spare time I now have a good arsenal of languages which I can use. One of my key learning resources has been Coursera, studying principles of computing in Python. It has focused on concepts which can transfer to any programming language.</p>
<p>I am very passionate about web/program development and have an eagerness to learn. While I may not know everything I am extremely resourceful in finding the answer.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
